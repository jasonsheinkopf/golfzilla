# GolfZilla
Arduino code for the immersive art exhibit Golfzilla. This project featured a 128-neopixel wraparound LED display that displayed an artists' image.
Patrons played a hold of miniature golf and a laser time-of-flight sensor detected when the ball went in the hole. This triggered a relay that
released a solenoid and opened a secret door. Players then spent time in a secret room while a timer on the LED display counted down a customizable
duration of time.

# Nothing Cheezy
